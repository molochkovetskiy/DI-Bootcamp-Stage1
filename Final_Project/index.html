                    On 20 December 2019, Arsenal appointed former club captain Mikel Arteta as the new head coach.Arsenal finished the league season in eighth, 
                    their lowest finish since 1994-95, but beat Chelsea 2-1 to earn a record-extending 14th FA Cup win. After the season, Arteta's title was changed 
                    from head coach to manager.On 18 April 2021, Arsenal were announced as a founding club of the breakaway European competition The Super League;
                    they withdrew from the competition two days later amid near-universal condemnation.
                    Arsenal finished the season in eighth place once again, not qualifying for a European competition for the first time in 26 years.
                    In the 2022-23 Premier League season, Arsenal returned to the Champions League with Arteta, after leading the league for most of the season, 
                    though succumbing to defending champions Manchester City. They are set to face the English champions in the 2023 FA Community Shield.
